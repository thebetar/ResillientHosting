# Introduction

For one of my university courses I learnt how important resilliency is within systems. Since docker compose is one of my favourite easy to run way of using replicas I decided to make a small demo and try this out.

## How to run

The steps to running this project are very simple, **if docker is installed**.

1. `docker compose build`
2. `docker compose up`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

After following these steps you will see an HTML page. As you can see after reach reload the container ID changes.
